/// The Tree sitter syntax tree for a single language.

/// This is really multiple (nested) different syntax trees due to tree sitter
/// injections. A single syntax tree/parser is called layer. Each layer
/// is parsed as a single "file" by tree sitter. There can be multiple layers
/// for the same language. A layer corresponds to one of three things:
/// * the root layer
/// * a singular injection limited to a single node in its parent layer
/// * Multiple injections (multiple disjoint nodes in parent layer) that are
///   parsed as though they are a single uninterrupted file.
///
/// An injection always refer to a single node into which another layer is
/// injected. As injections only correspond to syntax tree nodes injections in
/// the same layer do not intersect. However, the syntax tree in a an injected
/// layer can have nodes that intersect with nodes from the parent layer. For
/// example:
///
/// ``` no-compile
/// layer2: | Sibling A |      Sibling B (layer3)     | Sibling C |
/// layer1: | Sibling A (layer2) | Sibling B | Sibling C (layer2) |
/// ````
///
/// In this case Sibling B really spans across a "GAP" in layer2. While the syntax
/// node can not be split up by tree sitter directly, we can treat Sibling B as two
/// separate injections. That is done while parsing/running the query capture. As
/// a result the injections form a tree. Note that such other queries must account for
/// such multi injection nodes.
